module Cosmic
  # A plugin that makes SSH and SCP available to cosmos scripts, e.g. to perform actions on remote
  # servers or to transfer files. You'd typically use it in a cosmos context like so:
  #
  #     response = with ssh do
  #       exec :host => host, :user => user, :cmd => "uname -a"
  #
  #       first = true
  #       upload :host => service.host, :user => 'eng', :local => local, :remote => remote do |ch, name, sent, total|
  #         print "\r" unless first
  #         print "#{name}: #{sent}/#{total}"
  #         first = false
  #       end
  #       print "\n"
  #     end
  #
  # The plugin assumes that the locally running ssh agent process is configured to interact
  # with the remote servers without needing passwords (i.e. by having keys registered). In this
  # case, it will not need a configuration section unless you want more than one instance of the
  # plugin (which is not really necessary in this case as the plugin does not maintain state).
  #
  # Alternatively, you can configure the plugin with username and password, either directly or
  # via the environment's authentication mechanism (e.g. from ldap). In this case, more than one
  # plugin instance allows you to use different credentials for different remote servers.
  #
  # Note that this plugin will not actually connect to the remote servers in dry-run mode.
  # Instead it will only send messages tagged as `:ssh` and `:dryrun`.
